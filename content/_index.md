### Why does this site exist? 

Clear, public, data-driven analysis is much needed right now to help steer investments and policy towards effective, cost-efficient approaches as we aim for net-zero concrete by 2050.
There are many half-baked ideas, lab projects, and even charlatans in the green cement sector, and reporters are generally not succeeding at seeing through the hype. This is causing poorly placed investments and potentially even slowing down innovation. 

### Who is funding this work? 

-There is effectively nobody but the authors' time funding this work. 
-The site is run on the cheapest hosting possible and with virtually no cost to run other than time for maintenance, the hope is that it will remain free of unwanted influence. 
-The site aims to rely on verifiable facts and good writing rather than appealing simply to authority. 

### Why should I believe all this?

You don't have to! This site is being provided as a public service with as little bias as humanly possible, but you are encouraged to critically evaluate what is presented and confirm for yourself that it makes sense.
